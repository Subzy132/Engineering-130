# Engineering 130 Week 1
## Week 1

### Introduction
In this document I am going to be going over what I learnt over past week which was business week. So we learnt about basics of what makes an excellent elevator pitch, Agile and Scrum methodology, what is devops and I will give a short guide on how to download pyhton and then pycharm. I will also provide diagrams when necessary. 

### What makes an excellent elevator pitch?
- An effective pitch to keep the listener engaged and follow along what you rare saying 
- Use of power words to boost the emphasis on your achievements
- Keep it under 90 secs
- Try to not use filler words so you can be clear and concise

We first had to create our own elevator pitch and then present it in front of our cohort and then we looked back on our recording to see where we could give ourselves feedback. We took this feedback on board and then presented the pitch to a smaller group and the trainer also gave us feedback and we then came up with our final versions. There is still room for improvement but it includes everything I have achieved and gives a little insight into my background.

Hi, My name is Subhaan Hussain, I am a Junior DevOps Engineer for Sparta global. I have recently proudly achieved a Software engineering degree. My background has always been incredibly technical as I have studied IT in sixth form and I carried out work experience in an independent design consultancy called chapmanBDSP as an IT technician. Here I gained valuable DevOps skills like Team-work and professionalism. My goal is to work my way up from being a junior to a senior DevOps engineer where I can put my technical skills to use.  It is clear to see I have a genuine passion for tech and the way the world is advancing i would like to be a part of this innovative industry.

### What is Agile?

- Agile is a concept where you go through continuous small improvements through frequent releases
- It is a mindset which gives you the ability to create and respond to change as fast as possible

Our class was split up into 3 groups of 5 and we delivered 3 presentations.
The first presentation was on everything about devops, so what is devops and how does it benefit the business and the specific tools the devops engineer uses. We then got feedback from our peers and the trainer to take board. 

The second presentation was on what is agile and scrum. We then used the feedback we got from the last presentation to make this one even better and it was clear to see that there was an immense improvement from the quality of presentation and the content that was being taught. 

The third presentation we done was also about scrum and agile but we expanded on different aspects of it to get a deeper understanding. This also went really well because we constantly recieved so much feedback and everyone took this under consideration and this improvement was clear to see.

### What is Scrum?

- Scrum is a process that allows teams in software development to deliver business values in the shortest time by constantly checking their work.
- This could be a regular check up / calls or daily stand up.  So essentially this allows the team to learn through experiences, self-organize while working on a problem, and reflect on their wins and losses to continuously improve.
- Framework that aids teams to work together
- Constant cycle to provide an excellent product

### What is DevOps?

- Devops is a method to deliver your application while splitting the responsibility and workload.
- Devops integrates developers and operations teams in order to improve collaboration and productivity by automating infrastructure, automating workflows and continuously measuring application performance.

### What is the role of a DevOps Engineer?

- Good communication
- Soft skills ( willingness to learn, creativity, know when to ask for help etc)
- Understanding of relevant tools

### How does it benefit the business? 

- Ensure faster deployment
- Significant improvement in product quality
- More room for innovation 
- Promotes agility in the business
- Continuous delivery of software
- Increase in productivity of employees
- Lower cost of production

### More about Scrum

An Agile retrospective is a meeting that's held at the end of an iteration in Agile software development. During the retrospective, the team reflects on what happened in the iteration and identifies actions for improvement going forward. They will cover topics such as the individuals involved, interactions, processes and their definition of done

What went well in the Sprint
What could be improved
What will we commit to improve in the next Sprint


### How to conduct a retro



- Don't make it personal, don't take it personally.
- Listen with an open mind.
- Everyone's experience is valid.
- Set the time period you're discussing (last sprint, last quarter, entire project, etc.)
- Focus on improvement, rather than placing blame.

At the end of the day youre working as one team so you shouldn’t blame but you should rather focus on improvements.

### DOD and DOR

Definition of Ready is a different concept. It is a set of agreements that tells you when something is ready to begin. More correctly, “if something is good to begin”. E.g., when a user story is ready to be taken into a sprint, or when all the conditions are right for a team to begin a sprint.

Defining the definition of done. The Definition of Done is an agreed-upon set of items that must be completed before a project or user story can be considered complete. It is applied consistently and serves as an official gate separating things from being “in progress” to “done.

the definition of ready covers the requirements coming into the sprint
the definition of done covers the product coming out of the sprint

### Devops Lifecycle

Here is the Devops lifecycle. They are continously carrying out specific task in order to make a project the best it could possibly be.
