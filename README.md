## Week 1

### Introduction
In this document I am going to be going over what I learnt over past week which was business week. So we learnt about basics of what makes an excellent elevator pitch, Agile and Scrum methodology, what is devops and I will give a short guide on how to download pyhton and then pycharm. I will also provide diagrams when necessary. 

### What makes an excellent elevator pitch?
- An effective pitch to keep the listener engaged and follow along what you rare saying 
- Use of power words to boost the emphasis on your achievements
- Keep it under 90 secs
- Try to not use filler words so you can be clear and concise

### What is Agile?
- Agile is a concept where you go through continuous small improvements through frequent releases
- It is a mindset which gives you the ability to create and respond to change as fast as possible


### What is Scrum? 

- Scrum is a process that allows teams in software development to deliver business values in the shortest time by constantly checking their work.
- This could be a regular check up / calls or daily stand up.  So essentially this allows the team to learn through experiences, self-organize while working on a problem, and reflect on their wins and losses to continuously improve.
